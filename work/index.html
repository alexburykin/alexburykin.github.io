            of the technical challenges ahead.</p>
          <p class="text-lg font-light mb-4">Over time, I transitioned into management, leading pivotal initiatives that
            shaped the company’s technical infrastructure and growth strategy.</p>
          <p class="text-lg font-light">It was a journey that sharpened my leadership skills and deepened my

          <p class="text-lg font-light mb-4">DB2 was where I truly grew as an engineer. Starting as a Frontend Engineer,

          <p class="text-lg font-light mb-4">The transition from hands-on coding to leading large-scale projects wasn’t
            always easy, but it taught me the value of collaboration and communication.</p>
